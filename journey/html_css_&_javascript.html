                    The first three things I was taught about on the Full Stack Developer course was HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was only taught the basics of these three topics but many of the principles I learnt here have informed
                     my learning from that point, e.g. the introduction of variables. By creating this website it has helped me to remember and build upon what I learnt here by putting it all into practice. 
                    <br> <br>
                    These three are key to building the front end of a website. So far while learning to code I have preferred the back end element of it, I have quite enjoyed learning ruby and the things you can create with it. At
                     times while using HTML and CSS I have found it frustrating getting things how I want them to look, it is not just the case of dragging some boxes around the screen as some may think. While learning Ruby I have found it to be more intuitive to learn and write than JavaScript, however since creating this website I am starting to like the front end a bit more as this is what most people will see and appreciate.

                    Before learning anything about JavaScript I was taught about HTML & CSS. HTML is a markup language which is used to create web pages. HTML consists of various elements which can be used to organise and format a 
                    web page. For example when creating content for a web page you will use different elements or tags to represent headings and paragraphs, these are just two examples there are many more. Structuring websites in 
                    this way makes them accessible to everyone, it also allows other front end languages such as CSS and JavaScript to be used to make web pages more attractive and dynamic. 
                    <br><br>
                    The introductory lessons for these two languages were pretty short but I have built on this knowledge a reasonable amount while creating this website. All the learning here was practical, the website freeCodeCamp
                     was used where I worked through lots of short exercise in their browser based environment. FreeCodeCamp is definitely worth checking, another great resources which is free and covers a lot more subject, there 
                     is a Data Analysis with Python Course here which I wouldn't  mind giving a go when I have a spare 300 hours. The final exercise to bring these two together was to try and recreate the Google home page. I didn’t
                      find this exercise too difficult just my usual CSS dramas  of trying to get  objects to stay in place. You can see my attempt at this

                    As I have mentioned throughout this website, my memory is horrendous, this being one of the reasons why I decided to create it so that the skill fade wouldn’t kick in, I only wish I had started sooner. When I started 
                    to create this website I could tell that I had forgot a lot of the JavaScript I had previously learnt, what I hadn't lost was the understanding. This to me was shown as I wanted to create a graph in this website using JS, 
                    I found this relatively easy as I had that basic understanding of the language. I may have forget the need to use colons, brackets and that variables should be declared with let but I didn’t forget that understanding. 
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoyed JavaScript because this is where I started to learn how to code. The project work here was satisfying as I was bringing in what I had previously learnt with HTML and CSS to make interactive web content. These 
                    pieces of work can be seen below:
