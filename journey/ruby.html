                I started to learn Ruby in November 2020, it is now 7 months later. I have enjoyed learning Ruby but there are parts of the course such as TDD and recursion which have given me a headache, although these are not only unique to Ruby.  
                <br><br>
                My biggest problem with Ruby is that my code is waaaaaay too long. I achieve what needs to be done but I just tend to go a long and inefficient way about it. I try to improve on this by looking at other students solutions once I 
                have finished  the piece I am working on. I have booked on to an online course where you are able to talk to  tutors  about the work you submit so I am hoping that this will improve my coding. 
                <br><br>
                The Oden project is good because you learn a load of stuff and then you are given a substantial piece of work to complete to put into practice what you have learnt. I find that the work is challenging and it encourages you to 
                search the wider internet for solutions, this building on your knowledge base. Below I have listed some of the larger pieces of work I have completed.

                    This exercise was to create the game Tic-Tac-toe or as we call it in the UK Naughts and Crosses. This was the first proper programme I created using Ruby, I had put together smaller pieces of code where I had to manipulate strings,
                     arrays etc. but nothing where I had bring everything together which I had learnt to date. Although I completed this exercises looking back at it now I could have cleaned it up and added a bit more substance, this especially true 
                     <a href="https://ryanlue.com/posts/2017-03-03-how-to-structure-a-library"> here</a> looking at the examples of  some of the other students.  
                    <br><br>
                    What I took away from this is that I need to tighten my code up a lot and I need to make things more concise. I could have broken this down into a couple of files splitting up the Classes and Modules, to help me with this I read this article
                    just to understand Ruby filing conventions a bit more. A big chunk of the code in this programme wasn’t in a method and it was doing lots of things, I am guessing that this doesn’t matter to much for this piece of work but it would been better and 
                    tidier if I put this into a couple of methods which had specific jobs.

                    During the Web Dev 101 section in TOP I learnt the basics of how to build a web site, I thought that I would put this in to practice otherwise I would forget it all. I soon realised 
                    that it isn’t only just about creating a website there is the whole management aspect behind it too, this will be explored further in this section.
