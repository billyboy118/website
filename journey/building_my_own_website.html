            Building My Own Website

            <p>
                From creating this site I have learn that building a website is a mammoth task. One of the biggest things I underestimated was the time that that goes into creating the content. A couple of key things I have learnt while creating this site.
                
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I prefer working with Ruby than HTML, CSS and JS</li>
                <li>Time - creating this while working full time, learing Ruby and having a life was difficult, I must have gone a couple of months without working on this at points, but I had to find the time to get this out there</li>
                <li>Improve later on - there is a lot of things on this site which I dont like and which I know I can now do better. I soon realised if I made these improvements as I went along that I would get anywhere. Write all these improvements down and come back to them later on.
                    A good way to do this is on GitHub they have a free Kanban board tool which is pretty good, I have used this to help keep me on track.</li>   
            </ul>

            <p>
                I have a lot more that I want to add here about what I have learnt along the way. This will come, at the moment I just want to get this website published online and then improve as and when.
