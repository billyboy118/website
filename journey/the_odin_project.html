                Here I would like to talk about why I chose to study with The Odin Project (TOP) and what it is all about. At the time of writing 
                this I had been studying with TOP for about 10 months. During this time I had studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby, this all 
                among a variety of other subjects. The next thing I would be learning being the Ruby on Rails framework.  
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                So why did I start the Full Stack Developer course through The Odin project? For a while I have wanted to learn how to code as it does 
                interest me, I like to make things and I like using computers so why not put the two together? I have always used computers for games, 
                work, university etc. but never for the purpose of coding. I believe that studying this course will help me in my career, I am currently 
                a contractor in the tech sector where I provide programme support. In the future I would like to work at the project level in more of a 
                technical role. The big thing which spurred me and got me learning to code was during the first covid lockdown, I bought my first desktop 
                PC in years. I originally bought this for gaming but soon after I thought would give coding a go as I wanted to do something productive 
                while I was stuck indoors. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>What made me choose The Odin Project</h2>
            <p>
                I chose to study with The Odin Project as I thought that how the curriculum was structured and how you work along would suit me and it 
                gives you a clear path to follow. Looking at other sites and courses both paid and unpaid many of them are browser based, with TOP you 
                actually set up your own development environment, I will talk about this more in the next section.  
                <br><br>
                The Oden Project gives you a start and end point and you work along in a straight line, it Is an open source course that has been created 
                by over 1000 contributors. Many of the people who have contributed to this course work in the field, this give you the sense that what you 
                are learning is what you will actually need in the real world. I found that many sites out there follow a module approach, I see no issue 
                with this approach but if you were lacking  direction like me you may struggle in deciding which path to take, with TOP you don't have much 
                choice as the curriculum is focused on one thing, web development.
                <br><br>
                You will find that The Odin Project primarily uses material already out there on the web, I think that this is good in a sense as it gives 
                the course more breadth, one down side of this is that sometimes you do find yourself going off topic. A mixture of project work and short 
                exercises are used throughout the course. Some of the projects are quite large and take a while to complete while the exercises are smaller 
                and test the specifics you have just learnt. I have found that many other sites where you learn to code just focus on the smaller exercises 
                where you need to provide one correct answer. The projects which you work on in TOP have multiple requirements where you need to develop a 
                solution that works, this added layer of complexity tests you more than just completing short exercises. 
            </p>

            <h2>Set up your own development environment</h2>
            <p>
                A big selling point to me when deciding what course to take was that The Odin Project walks you through how to set up your own development 
                environment, they have a number of solutions for this based on your system. I first went for the recommend approach here and set up a virtual
                 machine in Windows where I ran Xubuntu which is a distribution of Linux, this basically running an operating system from your already 
                 running operating system, this is needed as some development tools have been designed to run on platforms such as Linux.  
                <br><br>
                Working on the VM was good to begin with but as time went on I found that I was using Xubuntu in the VM more than I was using applications 
                within Windows. One of the big disadvantages of using a WM Is that you donâ€™t fully utalise your hardware, after a bit of reading I bought 
                a 240GB SSD and set my computer up so that is could dual boot with Ubuntu another distribution of Linux, I talk more about my experience 
                with this here<insert link>. The Odin Project gave me the knowledge and the tools to be able to do this, I wouldn't have got this knowledge 
                if I had chosen to study with a typical browser based site. 
                    <br><br>
                Once I had the Linux OS in place I went on to install what I would initially need to start work on the course. Throughout the course you 
                download new additions, adding these tools to your development environment and to your own skill set. Working in this development environment 
                introduces you to the terminal and version control systems such as Git and GitHub. This does replicate real life and you will run into 
                problems associated with this, e.g. something isn't installing as it should. Studying with The Odin Project isn't just about coding, 
                there is also the peripheral activities as I have just discussed, these peripheral activities also preparing you for the real world. 
            </p>
            <h2>Drawbacks of The Odin Project</h2>
            <p>
                Firstly The Odin Project is an excellent learning resource. I have enjoyed working through it and I will continue to do so. I feel bad 
                having a moan about something which is free but I will talk about some of the downsides for me.  
            </p>

            <h3>Not having feedback</h3>
            <p class="h3Margin">
                Now I am not saying that a free site such as The Odin Project should give every one free tutors, but from a learning perspective not having 
                that feedback and engagement with someone slows down your development and could introduce bad habits into your work. You have nobody to tell 
                you that what you are doing it wrong or that there is a better way to do it. I know for sure that most of my work could be done better, 
                after I have completed a project I will reflect on my work and look at what other students have produced and see how mine could be improved. 
                The Odin Project does have an active Discord channel where you can raise any difficulties you having, the fantastic community is more than 
                happy to help with any queries people may have. 
            </p>
            <h3>Best case examples</h3>
            <p class="h3Margin">
                I think that if The Odin Project had best case examples this would somewhat address the point above. If for the project work there were 
                these examples I think that it would help as you could easily see where you need to improve. For myself, If the examples were walked and 
                talked through this would help gain a better understanding of why the code had been written that way, this would help inform how I would 
                code in the future.   
            </p>
            <h3>Learning Ruby</h3>
            <p class="h3Margin" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                This isn't really a drawback to be honest. But if you do want to learn a back end programming language you have to commit with Ruby if 
                studying with The Odin Project. While deciding what course I was going to take, if there were a similar course where I would have learnt 
                Python instead of Ruby I may have decided to do that instead, this partly to do with the hype around Python at the time. This isn't 
                really an issue for me as I believe that by learning one language well you can then carry this knowledge and understanding onto a new 
                language. I can see this already, even at the stage I'm at now I have looked at other languages and have some understanding with what 
                the code is trying to achieve.
