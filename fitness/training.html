                I would say for the past 12 years I have trained pretty regularly. My training pattern has changed throughout this period where there has been times I would focus on lifting weights 
                in the gym or I would priorities going out running over anything else. I always struggled to find the balance between CV and weight training as I would tend to favour one or the other, 
                this would have a negative impact on the method of training I was steering away from. 
                <br><br>
                More recently over the past couple of years and increasingly through lockdown I think I am in a good space. I have that balance of CV and resistance training, I am also doing a lot more 
                calisthenics. Training for me now is a habit, it is something I know should be doing every day. I do this because I like the benefits. I like being in good health, I like sleeping well 
                and I like having energy.

                There is always time to train

                <p class="item4l3 griditem rightjust">
                    I often hear people say 'I don't have time to train',  for some people this could be true, others not so much. My first question when people say this is 'how long do you spend watching 
                    the TV at night?'. If say the answer to this question is an hour, what you have here is time to train and not enough time to watch TV! This boils down to priorities. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Now I am not making out that I train every single day religiously. There are those days when you have had a long horrible day at work and you just can't be bothered. I wouldn’t fault 
                    anyone for sacking training off on days like these, I have done it and I will do it again. But, what I have also done is train on these days too. Even if it is just a 20 minute after a 
                    stressful day it will make you feel better. 
                </p>
                <h1 class="rightjust"> Have a plan you will stick to</h1>
                <p class="item4l3 griditem rightjust">
                    I touch on this in the Ironman page. You need to have a plan which you can stick to. You could have the best training plan ever created but if you don’t stick to it it's pointless. If you think a PT will help try it, I only really
                    have one experience with a PT. I asked one once to draw me up a training plan, he just stuck a load of exercises  down on a piece of paper, he didn't even ask if I had any injuries or what kind of training I enjoyed doing.  
                    <br><br>
                    To me it is important to have a plan which I like, If I like it the chances are that I will stick to it. If you don’t like certain exercise you don’t have to do them. If you don’t like to run jump on a bike, if you don’t like to
                     bike get on the rower, there is more than one way to achieve your goals.
                    <br><br>
                    I accept that there will be times when I deviate from my plan. At the time of writing this I have had a patchy couple of weeks, the gyms have been shut now for 3 months and I am getting bored shitless of training outside or in my house.
                     The first lockdown was okay as I was biking or running every day, I put a stop to this as the sessions were getting longer and I think that I was getting too skinny.
                    <br><br>
                    So given the fact that I do deviate from my plan, what is important is that I get back on track. I plan to train six days a week,  if this goes down to five I can live with that. On occasion it may go down to three or four which is acceptable
                     every once and a while. If I start getting to a point where I am regularly training 3 / 4 times a week that is when I know I need to get a grip of myself .
