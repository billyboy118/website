                 First of all I thought that I would put this chart in below just  to show that I do practice what I preach, as I have also created this web site to help with my coding in creating this graph I have used chart.JS which is pretty cool.
                  My original hope was that I would be able to integrate this with Garmin but it turns out Garmin dont have any public facing APIs so how I have had to do it is pull all my data from MyfItness pal and then I wrote a script in JS to map
                weights and data points as you can see here I have kept reasonable recrd of my weight since around August 2019, these weights are what I pulled of MyFintness Pal as CSV which is pulled from myGarmin connect, I will probaly get it off Garmin in the future as you cna only downlaod with a premiume account I did find out that you can access Graminconnect here and pull of your weight in a JSON format you can also request all of your data from Garmin, I have done this and may try and navigate my way through  all the data they have sent to me
            </p>
