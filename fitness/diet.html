                First of all I thought that I would put this chart in below just to show that I do practice what I preach. The biggest thing that stands out here is that I like a feed at the weekend and I am plateauing out at just 
                above 80kg.
                <br><br>
                In creating this graph I have used chart.JS which is pretty cool. My original hope was that I would be able to integrate this with my
                Garmin account somehow. I would have liked be able to update this graph automatically but it turns out that Garmin do not have any public facing APIs, I do talk more about how I went about creating this graph in the JS
                section of this site.

                First of all, as I have already said I don't believe in the word diet when used in the context of 'I am going on a diet', I believe in the words healthy eating and treat yourself. I have never been on a diet, I just 
                don’t think they are sustainable and they seem like too much hard work, but if they work for you go for it. I see diets as being a temporary solution which don’t really fix the problem.  
                <br> <br>
                I believe that the effective way lose weight and maintain that weight loss is a change in habits and lifestyle. Now, I am not saying that you need to stop eating pizza and drinking beer, I am also not going to say to
                only eat and drink in moderation. On occasion, I want to be able to go out, have 10 beers, and treat myself to a kebab at the end of the night, then I want to feel sorry for myself a couple of days after while eating
                pizza. So what I am going to say is moderate how often you don’t moderate. When I am no over indulging I tend to follow these rules below:  
                <h2>Calorie deficit</h2>
                To lose weight you need to have a calorie deficit, this is what I believe to be the one and only key to weight loss. In some form or another most diets are geared up around this although they may not use the words 
                calorie deficit. 
                <br> <br>
                You create a calorie deficit when you consume less calories than your body requires to maintain its current weight.  A sustained calorie deficit will result in weight loss. If you were to reduce your calorie intake 
                by 500-1000 calories a day you would lose 1-2 pounds a week<sup>1</sup>.   
                <br> <br>
                Your maintenance level is the number of calories your body requires to maintain its current weight, this is influenced by a number of factors such as age and weight. A big factor which impacts your maintenance level 
                is physical activity, physical activity increase your maintenance level allowing you to consume more calories. That 500-1000 calorie reduction a day doesn’t seem to hard now does it? 
                <h2>Count them calories</h2>
                I am not militant when it comes to counting calories but I will have a rough idea of my consumption on a daily basis. When I go food shopping I will always look at the calories of food items and this will impact my 
                decision on what to get. 
                <br><br>
                Now an example of when I have counted calories, what I discuss here is common sense but something I fall foul of. I looked at two items which I have most days of the week. These two items being granola and baking 
                potatoes. I used to buy large potatoes and I would free pour granola into my bowl.  
                <br><br>
                As you can see below, by making small daily changes it can make a big difference by the end of the week, 150 calories is basically a pizza.
                <br><br>


                <table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" > 
                    <tr>
                      <th>Food</th>
                      <th>Daily Reduction <br> (grams)</th>
                      <th>Daily Reduction <br> (calories)</th>
                      <th>Weekly Reduction <br> (grams)</th>
                      <th>Weekly Reduction  <br>(calories)</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Granola</td>
                        <td>25g</td>
                        <td>104</td>
                        <td>175g</td>
                        <td>728</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Baking Potato</td>
                        <td>150g</td>
                        <td>115</td>
                        <td>1050g</td>
                        <td>805</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr >
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td style="padding-top: 6px;"><b>TOTAL</b></td>
                        <td style="padding-top: 6px;"><b>1533</b></td>
                      </tr>
                </table>
                <br>
                 

                To achieve the above reduction it  wasn’t hard. Instead of buying large potato's I now buy medium. Instead of free pouring granola I now  measure it. By measuring it I pour it into a little tub which I know is roughly
                 the correct portion size, I don’t want to be faffing about with the scales getting it down to the gram first thing in the morning. 
                 
                 <h2>Thats it for now</h2>
                 More to come on this when I get around to it, I think i may discuss the following:
                 <ul style="padding-top: 9px; margin-top: 0px;">
                    <li>Give in to your post meal cravings</li>
                    <li>There will be days or weeks that you will crumble, this need to be accepted</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Preperation</li>
                </ul>
