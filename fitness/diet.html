                First of all I thought that I would put this chart in below just to show that I do practice what I preach. The biggest thing that stands out here is that I like a feed at the weekend and I am plateauing out at just 
                above 80kg. As I have also created this web site to help with me learning to code, in creating this graph I have used chart.JS which is pretty cool. My original hope was that I would be able to integrate this with 
                Garmin account somehow where I would be able to extract my weight but it turns out Garmin do not have any public facing APIs, I do talk more about how I went about creating this graph here.

                First of all, as I have already said I don't believe in the word diet when used in the context of 'I am going on a diet', I believe in the words healthy eating and treat yourself. I have never been on a diet, I just 
                don’t think they are sustainable and they seem like too much hard work, but if they work for you go for it. I see diets as being a temporary solution which don’t really fix the problem.  
                <br> <br>
                I believe that the effective way lose weight and maintain that weight loss is a change in habits and lifestyle. Now, I am not saying that you need to stop eating pizza and drinking beer, I am also not going to say to
                only eat and drink in moderation. On occasion, I want to be able to go out, have 10 beers, and treat myself to a kebab at the end of the night, then I want to feel sorry for myself a couple of days after while eating
                pizza. So what I am going to say is moderate how often you don’t moderate. When I am no over indulging I tend to follow these rules below:  
                <h2>Calorie deficit</h2>
                To lose weight you need to have a calorie deficit, this is what I believe to be the one and only key to weight loss. In some form or another most diets are geared up around this although they may not use the words 
                calorie deficit. 
                <br> <br>
                You create a calorie deficit when you consume less calories than your body requires to maintain its current weight.  A sustained calorie deficit will result in weight loss. If you were to reduce your calorie intake 
                by 500-1000 calories a day you would lose 1-2 pounds a week<sup>1</sup>.   
                <br> <br>
                Your maintenance level is the number of calories your body requires to maintain its current weight, this is influenced by a number of factors such as age and weight. A big factor which impacts your maintenance level 
                is physical activity, physical activity increase your maintenance level allowing you to consume more calories. That 500-1000 calorie reduction a day doesn’t seem to hard now does it? 
                <h2>Count them calories</h2>
