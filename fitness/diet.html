                First of all I thought that I would put this chart in below just to show that I do practice what I preach. The biggest thing that stands out here is that I like a feed at the weekend and I am plateauing out at just 
                above 80kg. As I have also created this web site to help with me learning to code, in creating this graph I have used chart.JS which is pretty cool. My original hope was that I would be able to integrate this with 
                Garmin account somehow where I would be able to extract my weight but it turns out Garmin do not have any public facing APIs, I do talk more about how I went about creating this graph here.

                First of all, as I have already said I don't believe in the word diet when used in the context of 'I am going on a diet', I believe in the words healthy eating and treat yourself. I have never been on a diet, I just 
                don’t think they are sustainable and they seem like too much hard work, but if they work for you go for it. I see diets as being a temporary solution which don’t really fix the problem.  
                <br> <br>
                I believe that the effective way lose weight and maintain that weight loss is a change in habits and lifestyle. Now, I am not saying that you need to stop eating pizza and drinking beer, I am also not going to say to
                only eat and drink in moderation. On occasion, I want to be able to go out, have 10 beers, and treat myself to a kebab at the end of the night, then I want to feel sorry for myself a couple of days after while eating
                pizza. So what I am going to say is moderate how often you don’t moderate. 
                <br><br>
                When I am no over indulging I tend to follow these rules below:
