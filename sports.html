                    I am by no means a fitness guru and I don't claim to be, I want to put across what has worked for me over the years. I don't plan on being preachy and telling you 
                    what to do, this is for you to decide. I have trained a lot over the years, being in the army has definitely influenced my current training regime and I am a firm 
                    believer in doing what works for you and sticking to it. At the moment I currently train 6 days a week I have completed a couple of marathons, loads of half marathons 
                    and an Ironman. I follow 3 principles which are key to me, these I discuss below.

                    My diet is by no means the pinnacle of sports nutrition and some have questioned its variety, however, it has played a part in my sustained weight loss over the last couple of 
                    years. I think it goes without saying that you are what you eat and and that your diet is key to being fit and healthy. I don’t believe in the word diet in the context 
                    of saying “I am going on a diet”, I believe in the words eating healthy and occasionally treating yourself. I think that a lifestyle change needs to be made which is 
                    sustainable in the long term.

                    As I have said, I try to train 6 days a week. I like to think that my workouts are wide ranging, they predominantly comprise of the following training types:
                </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li>Cardiovascular (CV) training</li>
                    <li>Circuit training</li>
                    <li>Interval training</li>
                    <li>Weight training</li>

                    I will be the first to admit that at times my training regimes is half cocked and stagnated so hopefully by creating this section will help me a bit too.

                <p class="item8l3 rightjust griditem">
                    Having a routine allows me to plan for the weeks ahead, how I train and my diet feeds into this. It is fair to say that there is no point in having a 
                    routine if you don’t stick to it, this being said if you do deviate or loose the plot completely you need to be able to pick it back up. I don’t claim 
                    to be able to perfectly be able to stick to a routine but I think the important thing is being able to get back into it if you  have had a crazy couple 
                    of day or you have been on holiday or anything like that.

                    I completed the Tenby Ironman In 2019 in roughly 13 hours, it was a cracking day, the atmosphere was amazing and the support from the locals was something else. 
                    I decide to give it a go for the challenge, prior to 2018 I had never touched a road bike and my swimming stroke of choice was breast. Not only did I have to 
                    train, I also had to learn two new disciplines, I like to think I have conditioned myself to running over the years so I wasn’t too worried about that. All this 
                    being said the Ironman did put me in hospital a couple of days later, you’ll have to carry on reading to find out why.
