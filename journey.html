                    I want to talk about my experience here while learning to code and how I have progressed through my studies while putting my own spin on things. 
                    Prior to 2020 I knew very little about coding and this is still true, it is a huge topic which branches of into many other areas of expertise, 
                    but I am getting there. I would say the closest that I had got to coding before this would be putting some crazy formulas together in Excel for 
                    work.

                    First of all please visit The Odin Project <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com">here</a>, this is where I started to learn how to code. It was in June a couple of months into the 
                    pandemic that I decided to give coding a go, It is now coming up to the end of 2020 and I am still going strong, this is largely down to The Odin Project being engaging, challenging 
                    and most importantly free.

                <p class="item6l3 griditem rightjust">
                    During the Web Dev 101 section in TOP I learnt the basics of how to build a web site, I thought that I would put this in to practice otherwise I would forget it all. I soon realised 
                    that it isn’t only just about creating a website there is the whole management aspect behind it too, this will be explored further in this section.

                    Having only heard these words in passing I was always keen to learn more and now I eventually have. I have only learnt the basics so far of 
                    which I am building on with the creation of this website. HTML basically being the structure of the website, CSS 
                    how the structure is styled and JavaScript, a browser side language which can be used to make your website more 
                    interactive.

                    When first reading about Ruby it was clear that this is a good language for beginners, I got this feeling when moving from JS over to Ruby as 
                    it was a bit intuitive. To me it isn’t about learning one specific language, it is about learning a language from which I can use the skills 
                    and principles which I have picked up to apply to different languages.
