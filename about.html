            Why did I create this website?
            </h2>
            <p class="griditem">
                I created this website for a number of reasons. During the COVID-19 pandemic I bought a new PC, I originally bought this for a bit
                of gaming but along the way I thought that I would learn how to code. I am currently studying a full stack developer course with The 
                Oden Project. TOP is pretty cool and free, I talk more about them in the coding section of this site.
                <br> <br>
                Early on in in my studying I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then moved on to Ruby. When I was starting to learn
                Ruby I realised that my brain is like a sieve and I have a terrible memory, I decided to create this website alongside my studies 
                to apply and develop what I have learnt and reduce any skill fade.
                <br> <br>
                The first problem I came across when building this site was, what would it be about? I thought that as I am currently learning to 
                code I will do it about this and the experience I have had while also giving me a platform to demonstrate what I have learnt. I also 
                like keeping fit so I thought I would chuck a bit of that in here and anything else random I have done along the way.

            <p class="griditem">
                I have come to learn that building this website from scratch is extremely time consuming, it isnâ€™t just the building I have had to 
                think about it is also the content. Then there are things like domain names, hosting, SSL Certificates and much more I have had to 
                learn about, basically the management side behind the website.
                <br> <br>
                I have been creating this website while working a full time job, studying a full stack developer course and I exercise 6 days a week, 
                I also like to think I have a social life. I realised from the beginning that I had to get the first version of this website out and 
                then iterate with improvements from there, I needed to do it like this otherwise I would have never made this site live. I have a long 
                list of improvements I want to make but <b>if I keep going back I will never go forward</b>.

            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p class="griditem">
                    I am not going to bore you too much about me, as I have said I learnt to code during the COVID-19 lock down here in the UK. Before 
                    this I had never really tried any coding apart from a bit of VBA while using Microsoft Excel at work. I currently work as a Project 
                    Coordinator so I have been able to use these skills in helping to get this site out of the door. Academically I have a BSc in Business 
                    and Management and a MSc in Project Management so learning how to code is a bit different to what I have done in the past.
